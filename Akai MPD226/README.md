1) This project belong in `Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Hardware/`
  - put simply, it should look something like `Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Hardware/Akai MPD226/...`
2) In the FL Studio MIDI settings, select `Akai MPD226 (user)` from the controller type dropdown.

### Adding your own functionality
I've configured this project so the only file you need to edit is `Akai MPD226/MPDHandler.py`.
To go straight to the fun stuff, start playing with the Input handler functions in that file.
